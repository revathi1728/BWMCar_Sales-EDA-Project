# 🚗 BMW Car Sales — Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project presents a beginner-friendly **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on BMW’s global car sales dataset.  
It aims to uncover sales trends, top-performing models, and customer preferences based on transmission, fuel type, and region.

---

## 📘 Project Overview

This notebook walks through the complete EDA process — from data cleaning to visualization — using Python libraries like **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**.  
The goal is to help understand how BMW’s sales have evolved over time and which factors influence them the most.

## 🧠 Analysis Workflow

### 1️⃣ Data Setup & Loading
- Imported necessary libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn).
- Loaded dataset and viewed its structure.

### 2️⃣ Data Cleaning
- Checked for missing values and duplicates.
- Reviewed data types and column names.
- Cleaned inconsistencies and formatted columns.

### 3️⃣ Univariate Analysis
- Examined single-variable trends:
  - Sales over years  
  - Top-selling models  
  - Regional distribution  
  - Fuel type and transmission breakdowns  

### 4️⃣ Bivariate & Statistical Insights
- Compared variables such as:
  - Fuel Type vs Region  
  - Sales Classification vs Year  
- Created a correlation matrix and boxplots for numeric data.

### 5️⃣ Key Findings
- Europe and North America dominated BMW sales.  
- Automatic transmission and petrol cars were most common.  
- SUVs and luxury segments showed increasing popularity in recent years.
